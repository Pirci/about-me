            As a developer, you spend most of your day in your code editor
            because it’s the place you actually write the code for your sites.
            All editors provide the plain text format needed for your code to be
            interpreted as a website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our favorite editor, VS Code, streamlines your work by letting you
            customize it with thousands of add-on features, functions, and
            themes so the tool you use most looks and works exactly the way you
            want. Atom was built by Microsoft.

          <p>
            Even if you’re freelancing, but especially if you’re part of a team,
            you need a reliable version control system to keep track of all the
            changes you make to your code over time. Trust us, at some point
            you’ll need to check or even revert to an earlier version of your
            code base!
          </p>
          <p>
            Git is a decentralized version control system which allows everyone
            on your team to work with the same files in the same project
            simultaneously without worrying that you might be overwriting
            someone’s work. It gives developers more freedom to work whenever
            and wherever since everyone has a local copy of the code.

          <p>
            Once you’ve made a solid start setting up the code for your site,
            you’ll want to be sure it’s savvy-looking too. By selecting some
            stunning front-end assets like fonts, icons, photos, and graphics,
            you can transform any site from boring to beautiful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google Fonts is our favorite front-end asset for the incredible
            selection it provides for your site typography. And Font Awesome is,
            well, awesome for the vast array of icons it offers (1,000+ for free
            and 7,000+ on the paid plan). Similarly, Unsplash boasts more than
            800,000 high-resolution stock photos you can use, all at no charge
            and with no copyright hassles.

          <p>
            Speaking of looking good, front-end frameworks are another must-have
            for front-end developers! Front-end frameworks are packages of files
            for styling and laying out your websites. Frameworks are made up of
            ready-made navigation menus, buttons, forms, typography, and other
            assets so you don’t have to write all that code yourself.

        <td>
          <p>
            CSS is a style sheet language used for styling your web pages. And
            you can make creating a beautiful site with CSS even simpler with
            preprocessors. A CSS preprocessor is basically a language that,
            after it’s processed, gives you even more CSS features. A
            preprocessor also lets you write code that’s easier to read,
            maintain, and share—all vital for working on a developer team or
            even on your own.

        <td>Javascript Frameworks / Libraries</td>
        <td>
          <p>
            JavaScript libraries are collections of code that make your sites
            interactive, provide better browser support, and add effects like
            animations, blog post tags, and auto-completing form fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like libraries, JavaScript frameworks can simplify your front-end
            development workflow. But frameworks differ from libraries in that
            frameworks provide the overall structure (or framework) for sites
            using JavaScript, while libraries focus on one or more specific
            aspects of a site.

        <td>
          <p>
            As you build your sites, often you’ll want to make modifications and
            test how they look “live” in your browser before committing the
            changes. You can do all this with developer tools, often called dev
            tools for short.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dev tools are a function built into modern web browsers that let you
            see the code behind each section of a site right in the browser with
            just a few clicks. (Hint: dev tools also let you peek at the code
            behind any website so they’re also a great way to learn a thing or
            two from other developers.)

          <p>
            Coding environments are sites that allow you to write code in an
            online editor and see the results immediately right next to your
            code. These platforms are a fast and useful way for developers to
            experiment and learn from other developers in the same environment.

            CodePen is the most diverse online coding environment in that you
            can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and even try out those
            libraries and frameworks you were just reading about.
